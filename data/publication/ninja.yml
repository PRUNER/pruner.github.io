  abstract: Debugging intermittently occurring bugs within MPI applications is challenging,
    and message races, a condition in which two or more sends race to match with a
    receive, are one of the common root causes. Many debugging tools have been proposed
    to help programmers resolve them, but their runtime interference perturbs the
    timing such that subtle races often cannot be reproduced with debugging tools.
    We present novel noise injection techniques to expose message races even under
    a tool’s control. We first formalize this race problem in the context of non-deterministic
    parallel applications and use this analysis to determine an effective noise-injection
    strategy to uncover them. We codified these techniques in NINJA (Noise INJection
    Agent) that exposes these races without modification to the application. Our evaluations
    on synthetic cases as well as a real-world bug in Hypre-2.10.1 show that NINJA
    significantly helps expose races.
