  abstract: The ability to record and replay program execution helps significantly
    in debugging non-deterministic MPI applications by reproducing message-receive
    orders. However, the large amount of data that traditional record-and-reply techniques
    record precludes its practical applicability to massively parallel applications.
    In this paper, we propose a new compression algorithm, Clock Delta Compression
    (CDC), for scalable record and replay of non-deterministic MPI applications. CDC
    defines a reference order of message receives based on a totally ordered relation
    using Lamport clocks, and only records the differences between this reference
    logical-clock order and an observed order. Our evaluation shows that CDC significantly
    reduces the record data size. For example, when we apply CDC to Monte Carlo particle
    transport Benchmark (MCB), which represents common non-deterministic communication
    patterns, CDC reduces the record size by approximately two orders of magnitude
    compared to traditional techniques and incurs between 13.1% and 25.5% of runtime overhead.
