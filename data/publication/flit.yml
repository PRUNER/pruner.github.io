  abstract: "Understanding the extent to which computational results
  can change across platforms, compilers, and compiler flags can go a
  long way toward supporting reproducible experiments. In this work,
  we offer the first automated testing aid called FLiT (Floating-point
  Litmus Tester) that can show how much these results can vary for any
  user-given collection of computational kernels. Our approach is to
  take a collection of these kernels, disperse them across a
  collection of compute nodes (each with a different architecture),
  have them compiled and run, and bring the results to a central SQL
  database for deeper analysis. Properly conducting these activities
  requires a careful selection (or design) of these kernels, input
  generation methods for them, and the ability to interpret the
  results in meaningful ways. The results in this paper are meant to
  inform two different communities: (a) those interested in seeking
  higher performance by considering IEEE unsafe optimizations, but
  then want to understand how much result variability to expect, and
  (b) those interested in standardizing compiler flags and their
  meanings, so that one may safely port code across generations of
  compilers and architectures. By releasing FLiT, we have also opened
  up the possibility of all HPC developers using it as a common
  resource as well as contributing back interesting test kernels as
  well as best practices, thus extending the floating-point
  result-consistency workload we contribute. This is the first such
  workload and result-consistency tester underlying floating-point
  reproducibility of which we are aware."
