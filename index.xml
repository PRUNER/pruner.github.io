      <description>Description  Reproducibility is highly desirable for parallel applications, but as they are run on increasingly large and heterogeneous platforms, reproducibility of numerical results or code behaviors is becoming less and less obtainable. The same code can produce different results or occasional failures such as a crash on different systems or even across different runs on the same hardware. PRUNERS is a research and development project that aims at innovating scalable tools and techniques to aid applications in obtaining reproducibility.</description>

      <description>ReMPI Description ReMPI is a highly scalable scalable record-and-replay tool for MPI applications. ReMPI records the order of MPI message matching in one run and can deterministically replay it during subsequent runs. One of the supported modes uses Clock Delta Compression (CDC) for running at extreme-scale. CDC can reduce the record size down to the bare minimum, which allows ReMPI to keep record data on node-local storage, and drastically improve scalability versus writing to a shared file system.</description>

      <description>FLiT Description Floating-point Litmus Tests is a test infrastructure for detecting varibility in floating-point code caused by variations in compiler code generation, hardware and execution environments.
FLiT works by building many versions of the test suite, using multiple C++ compilers, floating-point related settings (i.e. flags) and optimization levels. These tests are then executed on target platforms, where a representative &amp;lsquo;score&amp;rsquo; is collected into a database, along with the other parameters relevant to the execution, such as host, compiler configuration and compiler vendor.</description>

      <description>Ninja Description Ninja (Noise INJection Agent) is a smart network noise injector for quickly exposing unindended MPI message races. Ninja uses innovative network noise injection techniques to increase the chances of racy, incorrect MPI message matching within the target MPI application. Ninja has been shown to reproduce unsafe message races consistently within large production applications and can do this up to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional testing approach (i.</description>

      <description>Archer Description Archer is a data race detector for OpenMP programs.
Archer combines static and dynamic techniques to identify data races in large OpenMP applications, leading to low runtime and memory overheads, while still offering high accuracy and precision. It builds on an open-source tools infrastructure including LLVM, ThreadSanitizer, and OMPT to provide portability.
Software Archer is an open-source tool and can be obtained on GitHub .
Quick Start Installation  Spack: Recommended for curious users</description>
