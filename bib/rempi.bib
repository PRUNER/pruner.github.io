	Abstract = {The ability to record and replay program execution
                  helps significantly in debugging non-deterministic
                  MPI applications by reproducing message-receive
                  orders. However, the large amount of data that
                  traditional record-and-reply techniques record
                  precludes its practical applicability to massively
                  parallel applications. In this paper, we propose a
                  new compression algorithm, Clock Delta Compression
                  (CDC), for scalable record and replay of
                  non-deterministic MPI applications. CDC defines a
                  reference order of message receives based on a
                  totally ordered relation using Lamport clocks, and
                  only records the differences between this reference
                  logical-clock order and an observed order. Our
                  evaluation shows that CDC significantly reduces the
                  record data size. For example, when we apply CDC to
                  Monte Carlo particle transport Benchmark (MCB),
                  which represents common non-deterministic
                  communication patterns, CDC reduces the record size
                  by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to
                  traditional techniques and incurs between 13.1% and
                  25.5% of runtime overhead.},
