	Abstract = {OpenMP plays a growing role as a portable
                  programming model to harness on-node parallelism,
                  yet, existing data race checkers for OpenMP have
                  high overheads and generate many false positives. In
                  this paper, we propose the first OpenMP data race
                  checker, ARCHER, that achieves high accuracy, low
                  overheads on large applications, and
                  portability. ARCHER incorporates scalable
                  happens-before tracking, exploits structured
                  parallelism via combined static and dynamic
                  analysis, and modularly interfaces with OpenMP
                  runtimes. ARCHER significantly outperforms TSan and
                  Intel{\textregistered} Inspector XE, while providing
                  the same or better precision. It has helped detect
                  critical data races in the Hypre library that is
                  central to many projects at Lawrence Livermore
                  National Laboratory and elsewhere.},

	Abstract = {Neither static nor dynamic data race detection
                  methods, by themselves, have proven to be sufficient
                  for large HPC applications, as they often result in
                  high runtime overheads and/or low race-checking
                  accuracy. While combined static and dynamic
                  approaches can fare better, creating such
                  combinations, in practice, requires attention to
                  many details. Specifically, existing
                  state-of-the-art dynamic race detectors are aimed at
                  low-level threading models, and cannot handle
                  high-level models such as OpenMP. Further, they do
                  not provide mechanisms by which static analysis
                  methods can target selected regions of code with
                  sufficient precision. In this paper, we present our
                  solutions to both challenges. Specifically, we
                  identify patterns within OpenMP runtimes that tend
                  to mislead existing dynamic race checkers and
                  provide mechanisms that help establish an explicit
                  happens-before relation to prevent such misleading
                  checks. We also implement a fine-grained blacklist
                  mechanism to allow a runtime analyzer to exclude
                  regions of code at line number granularity. We
                  support race checking by adapting ThreadSanitizer, a
                  mature data-race checker developed at Google that is
                  now an integral part of Clang and GCC; and we have
                  implemented our techniques within the
                  state-of-the-art Intel OpenMP Runtime. Our results
                  demonstrate that these techniques can significantly
                  improve runtime analysis accuracy and overhead in
                  the context of data race checking of OpenMP
                  applications.},
