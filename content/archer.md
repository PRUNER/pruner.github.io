**ARCHER** is a data race detector for OpenMP programs.

ARCHER combines static and dynamic techniques to identify data races in large OpenMP applications, leading to low runtime and memory overheads, while still offering high accuracy and precision. It builds on open-source tools infrastructure such as LLVM, ThreadSanitizer, and OMPT to provide portability.
