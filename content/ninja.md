## Description

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;"><b>Ninja</b></span> is a smart network noise injector
for quickly exposing unindended MPI message races.
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ninja</span> uses innovative newtork noise injection
techniques to increase the chance for a racy, incorrect MPI message matching within the target
MPI application. NINJA has been shown to reproduce unsafe message races consistently within
large production applications and can do this up to two orders of magnitude faster than the
traditional testing approach (i.e., random noise injection).

## Software

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Ninja</span> is open-source software and can be obtained on <a class="smooth-link" title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/PRUNERS/NINJA">GitHub <i class="fa fa-github"></i>.
